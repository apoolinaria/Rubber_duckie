# Rubber_duckie

### An iconic rubber duck that helps developers debug their code by asking leading questions

The logic of debugging  prompts start with general most common syntax and type errors and gradually become more granular and specific. The duck is able to personalize the user debugging session by naming the function/object that is not performing to the expectations and lead the user through questions that prompts  the user to come back to the basics and rethink what is their initial functionality idea was and break it down into smaller pieces to identify the problem.
After the session limit has been reached a link to google pops up. After all its just a duck, its not allmighty
